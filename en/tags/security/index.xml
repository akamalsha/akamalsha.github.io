      <description>&lt;p&gt;Centralised Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) in networks is facilitated by the RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) protocol, which is extensively utilised for VPNs and Wi-Fi. But there is no security when using UDP with standard RADIUS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using TCP and creating secure TLS (Transport Layer Security) connections, RadSec (RADIUS Security) improves RADIUS. User credentials are shielded from interception and manipulation by this encrypted and secure transmission method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For today&amp;rsquo;s sophisticated networks, RadSec is perfect since it not only increases security but also dependability and scalability. Through the combination of strong security and dependable data transfer, RadSec adoption enhances network access management.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
